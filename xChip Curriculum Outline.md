## Front matter
Introduction
* What is an xChip? Where do they come from? 

xChip Glossary (possibly break this up, Possibly forgoe this and put the info in the assocaited lab?)
* compilation of each chips capabilities, characteristics, and a link to the associated lab 
* Each lab's materials list should link back here.

Set Up and Install Arduino IDE
* The software platform used to code xCHips. Install the program and drivers.

Install xChip Libraries
* This could technically be combined with the last tutorial, but they're both a bit time consuming.

## Labs
> How many labs should there be?

Lab 1: Hello World on OLED
* Basic code structure, syntaxes
* Have them upload a code, minor modifications
* No deeper learning, because this lab will be a lot of new info already

Lab x: Light Sensor
* How does the chip work?
* output values from sensor to OLED, UVA/UVB  and visible
* DL: Libraries

Lab x: Temperature, Humidity etc
* How does the chip work?
* ouput values to Serial monitor (It's really similar otherwise to the light sensor lab)
* Serial monitor basics, 
* DL: Baud Rate

Lab x: Wifi

* This seems tricksy...
* DL: How wifi works

Lab x: Light Sensor Logic 
* Cover the sensor (using if/them) have the OLED pop up with soemthing like "It's Dark" and "It's light"
* need to find out how the light sensor sends back values
* DL: Logic gates

Lab Final: Use ALL THE CHIPS!
