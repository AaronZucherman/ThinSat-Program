# Style Guide

## Program and Hardware Name Standards

* XinaBox - the product line
* xChips - the chips themselves
* xSystem - a single system of connected xChips

> Pro-Tip: Put extra information, hints, colloquial explanations, tips in quote boxes


## Lab Information

At the beginning of each lab, include a list of required items.
Computer with Arduino IDE is assumed, don't put it in the list
Not a 'capitalized' list.
When it's made, we can have each item in the BOM link to an info page about each chip.

To perform this lab you will need:
1. IP01 xChip- USB module
2. CW01 xChip- WiFi module and processor 
3. OD01 xChip- OLED display module
4. 2 connector pieces

(Include a horizontal line after the BOM)
